  content : "I love to live healthy and share some of my recipes here. If you’ve ever clicked on a recipe blog only to find yourself reading a novella about the butter cow’s emotional journey, congratulations—you’ve made it to the right place. Around here, we believe in food, not fluff. Sure, I could tell you about the glorious morning I plucked the basil for my pesto (spoiler: it was from a supermarket bag), but let’s cut to the chase: You just want to know how much basil you need. Most of my recipes, are sugar-free and gluten-free, some of them are vegan."
